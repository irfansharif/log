log
===

Leveled execution logs for Go; minimal interface with fine grained control
(file level, sub-package level, severity) for log evaluation.

This is an amalgamation of ideas from multiple logger implementations, notably:
  - google/glog
  - go-kit/kit/log
  - upspin/log
  - cockroachdb/pkg/log
