LOG
===

Leveled execution logs for Go; minimal interface with fine grained control
(file level, sub-package level, severity) for log evaluation.

This is an amalgamation of ideas from multiple logger implementations, notably:
  - google/glog
  - go-kit/kit/log
  - upspin/log
  - cockroachdb/pkg/log

Intended top-level usage:

  $ <binary-name> -help
  Usage of <binary-name>:
    -log-dir string
          Write log files in this directory.
    -log-to-stderr
          Log to standard error.
    -log-level (info|debug|warn|error|fatal)
          Log level for logs emitted (global, can be overrided using
          -log-filter).
    -log-filter value
          Comma-separated list of pattern:level settings for file-filtered logging.
    -log-backtrace-at value
          Comma-separated list of filename:N settings, when any logging statement at
          the specified locations are executed, a stack trace will be emitted.

  $ <binary-name> -log-level info \
                  -log-dir /path/to/dir \
                  -log-to-stderr \
                  -log-filter f.go:warn,g/h/*.go:debug
                  -log-backtrace-at y.go:42

The flags (or some variation thereof) will have to be provided/registered by
the library user, this library simply provides the hooks the user can then use
to configure the logger as needed. These hooks can be invoked at runtime (in
fact, we explicitly avoid init time hooks and global loggers). What this means
is that if needed, a running service could opt-in to provide open endpoints
to accept logger reconfigurations (via RPCs or otherwise).

Assuming <binary-name> from above allows for an authenticated RPC from another
helper binary:

  $ <binary-name>-debugger -help
  Usage of <binary-name>-debugger:
    -addr host:port
          Server address in form of host:port for running instance of
          <binary-name> that is to be configured.
    -log-dir string
          Configure server to write log files in this directory.
    -log-to-stderr
          Configure server to log to standard error.
    -log-level (info|debug|warn|error|fatal)
          Configure server to log at specified level.
    -log-filter value
          Comma-separated list of pattern:N settings for file-filtered logging
          to configure server to apply.
    -log-backtrace-at value
          Comma-separated list of filename:N settings, when any logging statement at
          the specified locations are executed, a stack trace will be emitted.

  $ <binary-name>-debugger -addr <host>:<port> \
                           -log-level debug \
                           -log-dir /path/to/another/dir \
                           -log-filter x.go:debug
                           -log-backtrace-at y.go:42
